# Strength Tracker App: Current State and Future Development

## Current State

The Strength Tracker application is a functional workout tracking system with the following implemented features:

### Authentication System
- User registration and login functionality
- JWT-based authentication
- Route guards for protected routes
- Token management

### Workout Management
- Create, read, update, and delete workouts
- Add exercises to workouts
- Track sets with reps and weight for each exercise
- Mark workouts as completed
- Basic workout listing and filtering

### Technical Implementation
- Angular frontend with reactive forms and signals
- NestJS backend with proper API endpoints
- PostgreSQL database with Drizzle ORM
- Clean architecture with separation of concerns
- Responsive UI with modern design

## What Needs to Be Done

Based on the analysis of the codebase, the following areas need development:

### High Priority
1. **Progress Tracking and Analytics**
   - Implement visualizations for strength progress over time
   - Add performance metrics and analytics dashboard
   - Create charts for weight/rep progression

2. **Exercise Library**
   - Create a database of common exercises with descriptions
   - Implement exercise search and categorization
   - Add exercise images or animations

3. **User Profile and Settings**
   - Develop user profile management
   - Add personal records tracking
   - Implement user preferences and settings

### Medium Priority
4. **Workout Templates**
   - Allow saving and reusing workout templates
   - Implement quick-start from previous workouts
   - Add routine scheduling

5. **Dashboard and Reporting**
   - Create a user dashboard with key metrics
   - Implement reporting and export functionality
   - Add summary statistics and insights

6. **Mobile Optimization**
   - Enhance mobile experience
   - Consider developing native mobile apps

### Future Enhancements
7. **Social Features**
   - Add sharing capabilities
   - Implement community features
   - Create trainer/client relationship functionality

8. **Nutrition Integration**
   - Add basic nutrition tracking
   - Implement calorie and macro tracking
   - Connect nutrition to workout performance

9. **Goal Setting**
   - Implement goal-setting functionality
   - Add progress tracking against goals
   - Create achievement system

10. **Notifications and Reminders**
    - Add workout reminders
    - Implement consistency tracking
    - Create streak and habit formation features

## Next Steps Recommendation

1. Focus on implementing the high-priority features first, starting with progress tracking and analytics
2. Gather user feedback on the current implementation to refine requirements
3. Consider creating a roadmap with milestones for the medium and future enhancement features
4. Implement automated testing to ensure stability as new features are added
